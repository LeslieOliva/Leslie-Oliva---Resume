        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Elementary Education</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Leslie Oliva has received her Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies at the University of California, Riverside. In three short years she received her degree and California teaching credentials. With a minor in Spanish she is qualified to teach elementary level students in both languages. Leslie is also an avid American Sign Language translator, so she is able to teach those who need that accommodation. Leslie has a spotless record and has passed every background check performed at Riverside Unified School District. <br><br>

        
During her time at the University of California, Riverside Leslie was a mentor in the national organization known as “Big Brothers Big Sisters.” This upcoming fall will be her 8th year with this organization and helping young children who struggle with their personal and academic life. Students have noted that she helped them get through the struggles of making friends, growing up, and figuring out how to do school work. After her 4th year Leslie was offered a position as the creative director for six elementary schools within the RUSD district who are a part of the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. She was responsible for creating weekly activities both Littles and Bigs could enjoy and work through together. Aside from this organization, Leslie was an AVID tutor at a local Riverside high school. She began tutoring during her sophomore year of high school, but it was not until her freshman year of college when she began tutoring professionally. Leslie was responsible for tutoring 6-7 students during every class period in subjects including algebra, AP Physics, AP Biology, and BC Calculus. During this time of her teaching career she was able to complete her teaching hours required to get her teaching credentials. Her lesson plans were mentioned to be almost flawless as she was capable of engaging students and making student participation increase. During her third year of college Leslie began a part time job as a preschool teacher at a local church group. She was in charge of two teaching assistants and a total of 16 students. This opportunity allowed her to see what the future holds for her, and enticed her even more. 
<br><br>

        Leslie Oliva has also briefly taught students while studying abroad during her third year of college. She traveled to Austria where she was able to assist a foreign language teacher at a local Austrian high school. Leslie has received multiple awards including but not limited- Dean’s List with Distinction (all three years), President’s Award for Educational Achievement, National Merit Scholar and many more. She is currently applying to multiple school districts in hopes of landing a job that will help her grow as a teacher. She prefers to become a teacher at a Title 1 school, since she knows the importance of going to a school where teachers truly care about you. It goes without saying that any opportunity presented will be greatly appreciated, as long as she can help the future. If there are any questions or concerns regarding any of the information presented up above Leslie can be reached through her primary email.
